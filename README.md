# PL/SQL Repository

This repository is dedicated to my journey and progress in PL/SQL coding.

## Purpose

- Practice and improve PL/SQL skills
- Store scripts, procedures, functions, and exercises
- Track learning milestones and completed topics

## Progress

- [x] Repository initialized
- [x] Git workflow guide created 
- [ ] Basic SELECT statements
- [ ] Joins and subqueries
- [ ] Procedures and functions
- [ ] Error handling
- [ ] Advanced PL/SQL features

## Git Workflow Guide

ðŸ“‹ **New**: Check out `GIT_WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md` for comprehensive instructions on:
- Fixing git push rejection errors
- Proper git workflow best practices
- Handling merge conflicts
- Quick reference commands

ðŸš€ **Quick Fix**: Run `bash fix-git-push.sh` to see a demonstration of resolving push conflicts.

**Common Issue**: If you get `! [rejected] main -> main (fetch first)`, the solution is:
```bash
git pull origin main  # Pull remote changes first
git push origin main  # Then push will succeed
```

Feel free to explore the code and follow my progress!
